# Folders
- "application" folder contains the files for our application. You can find a README.md inside the folder.
- "d3" folder contains the files for static html files. You can find a README.md inside the folder.
- "training" folder contains the files for building models. You can find a README.md inside the folder.
- "sparkproject" folder contains the files for all our spark projects built with SBT. You can find a README.md inside the folder.

# Notice
You can find the path to our data in every "sc.textFile(filepath)" statement. I will keep all the data under these paths before the project is graded; therefore, you can just copy and paste the code to execute. Please note that "saveAsTextFile" statements may fail because the files already exist.
