Folders:
1. "application" folder contains the files for our application. You can find a AppReadme.txt inside the folder.
2. "training" folder contains the files for building models. You can find a TrainingReadme.txt inside the folder.
3. "sparkproject" folder contains the files for all three sparkproject built with SBT. You can find a SparkProjectReadme.txt inside the folder.

Notice:
1. You can find the path to our data in every "sc.textFile(filepath)" statement. I will keep all the data under these paths before the project is graded; therefore, you can just copy and paste the code to execute. Please note that "saveAsTextFile" statements may fail because the files already exist.
